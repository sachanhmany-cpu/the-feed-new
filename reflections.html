        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>Most of the time, I use the internet for schoolwork, entertainment, social media, and finding information. Honestly, when most of these pictures were taken, I was probably doing homework or trying to multitask between school and other online distractions. The internet is such a central tool for my daily life that it’s hard to imagine functioning without it. 

            The idea of the web as something “handmade” stuck with me, because it suggests that websites (and the internet in general) don’t have to just be polished, corporate, or impersonal. They can be messy, personal, creative, and alive.
        </p>
        <p> For my own hopes for the internet and online communities, I want it to be a safe place where people are free to create without fear. I hope it can inspire people and give them joy, so that when you leave the internet, you feel positive and like you gained something meaningful. The internet should be a space that encourages imagination, connection, and growth rather than negativity or pressure.</p>
